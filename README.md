Hello World... Just kidding.

My name is Scott Cahill.  I have been an auto mechanic for over fifteen years.
But the time has come to move on to bigger and better things.  I am trying to 
become a software developer.  It is hard but Im finding it more and more interesting.
Please feel free to look at my code and any input is greatly appreciated.
